## Getting Started

Here's a compressed log file. Extract it and have a quick look at the format.

This is a command line tool that parses the log and presents the following info to the user:

1. What are the number of requests served by day?	
2. What are the 3 most frequent User Agents by day?
3. What is the ratio of GET's to POST's by OS by day?

Uses : 
1. Built Python libraries
2. Scan the file & parse the file
3. Has ability to set the log level for debugging
4. App version can be known
