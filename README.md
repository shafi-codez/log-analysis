## Getting Started

Here's a compressed log file. Extract it and have a quick look at the format.

Now, write a command line tool that parses the log and presents the following info to the user:

What are the number of requests served by day?	
What are the 3 most frequent User Agents by day?
What is the ratio of GET's to POST's by OS by day?

Guidelines
Use the following tools:

GitHub 
Ruby or Python
Your favorite editor
Organize the project as you would normally structure a production-ready tool.

Bonus Points
Add command line switches (e.g., verbose mode)
Provide a help screen
Provide sufficient test coverage
