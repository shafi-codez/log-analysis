## Getting Started

Here's a compressed log file. Extract it and have a quick look at the format.

Now, write a command line tool that parses the log and presents the following info to the user:

What are the number of requests served by day?	
What are the 3 most frequent User Agents by day?
What is the ratio of GET's to POST's by OS by day?
